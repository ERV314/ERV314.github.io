		<p>Hey! My name is Ella Voigt. I am a Junior in High School and I do my schoolwork online. I love to do all sorts of outdoor activities. I downhill ski and snowboard a lot in the winter and I also cross-country ski. I absolutely love mountain biking! I race cross-country mountain bikes fairly competitively throughout the state, but I also do some out-of-state races. This year I am traveling to compete in some US. Cup races, which are international-level races that take place here in the States! I also like to downhill mountain bike for fun and to help me build my skills. Additionally, I love paddleboarding, hiking, ultimate frisbee, white water rafting, and pretty much anything else I can do outside with my friends. I have an amazing church and I get to go camping with my whole church each summer, worship, and play on the lake. I am pretty good at school and I usually enjoy it. My favorite class right now is probably my American Literature class, but I am taking a lot of fun electives too. I probably like my Physics class the least even though it is really cool, because it is a lot of work and is sometimes hard to understand. I love to read and my favorite books are probably The Hunger Games, The Count of Monte Cristo, The Hiding Place, and Wuthering Heights. I also love to eat food! I would say my favorite food is tied between my mom's biscuits and gravy and potatoes of any sort. I hope you enjoyed getting to know a bit about me!</p>
